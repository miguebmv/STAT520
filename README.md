# Mental Health and Technology Usage Analysis

This repository hosts the code and resources for our final project on exploring the relationship between technology usage and mental health, as part of the STAT 520 course. Our analysis leverages the **Mental Health and Technology Usage Dataset** from Kaggle, aiming to investigate how various aspects of technology usage (e.g., social media hours, screen time, and gaming) correlate with mental health indicators like stress levels, sleep quality, and overall mental health status.

## Project Objectives

The primary goals of this project are:
- To analyze statistical relationships between technology usage patterns and mental health metrics.
- To build predictive models assessing the impact of technology on mental well-being.
- To explore unsupervised learning techniques to identify common user behavior patterns based on technology usage.

## Key Components
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: Initial data inspection, handling of missing values, and pre-processing for analysis.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Hypothesis testing and inferential statistics to determine significant correlations.
3. **Machine Learning**:
   - **Supervised Learning**: Models predicting mental health status based on technology usage.
   - **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering to identify distinct user groups with similar technology and mental health profiles.
4. **Visualizations**: Graphs and charts that illustrate key insights and findings.

## Tools and Languages
- **Python**: Primary language for data analysis, statistical tests, and modeling.
- **R** (optional): Used for additional statistical tests if required.
- **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**: Key libraries for analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
